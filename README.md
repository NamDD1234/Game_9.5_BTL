# Game_9.5_BTL
## A little personal feeling

Hello everyone. I am Dinh Nam Do - the author of the game that you read about over there. I went through a stressful presentation, right from the start, where I tried to edit the READ_ME to the best of my ability the night before but it wasn't accepted. After that, under the efforts of convincing the lecturer about my abilities, I achieved 9.5 (although the way to achieve it was a bit .......). But that wasn't my original goal. I want more, after all the days I spent diligently exploring, learning about algorithms, game trends, and many other related things. I really really want an explanation as to why I didn't get 10, what's the difference in my game compared to the other guys who got 10, in terms of algorithms, in terms of visuals, or in terms of something else. 

But it's great, I got you, be it future UET students or someone else. I hope that if you are a UET student and have to make a game like I am now, please help me upgrade it, become more perfect to reach 10 points, prove that I am not worthy of achieving it, as well as piecing together my dream of participating in the production of an fps game.

Thank you for taking the time to read a few lines of my confession.

Note: If possible, please contact me to share the joy. I trust and am proud of you. 
## About the game

Above is the game I used to present. It should have been on the other side, but I forgot :) (luckily the lecturer didn't notice so it was okay). I planned to upload it before the presentation but was afraid of losing points so I didn't (but I was scolded in the read_me section for editing it too late xD)
